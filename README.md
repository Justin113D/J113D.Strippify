## Shouldn't it be "Stripify" with one P?

Yes. Probably. I first wrote this algorithm back in 2019, I didn't know better. 
In fact, I did not know better until after I finally uploaded the code on nuget 
in 2025 that I was told "Strippify" is incorrect, but changing it now is too much work, 
so I decided I'd rather stick with my mistakes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
